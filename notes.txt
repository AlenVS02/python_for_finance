Financial data resources:

    In order to connect to web servers and gather data from them, one must first learn to use and implement APIs into one's code.

    Financial data APIs available for use:
        • iex (recommended if on python 3)
        • MORNINGSTAR (recommended)
        • ALPHA VANTAGE (recommended)
        • Quandl
        • YAHOO! finance data (Discontinued)

    pandas-datareader will help extract data from an API.

    (For practice and a much more complete learning experience, use the .csv files provided in the course.)


Using Quandl:

Quandl is a platform that provides economic, financial, and alternative datasets. These can be used for finance in python.
First, one must import the Quandl library to be able to use it.
